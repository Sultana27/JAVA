## Project B: Home Tour 

# For this project, we will be building a similar kind of application, but rather than an adventure game we'll just use it to present an interactive "tour" of a home - maybe your current home, maybe your dream home. In any case, the pattern will be exactly the same as other text-based games:

 --->Display prompt
  -->Collect input
  --->Process input as a command
  --->Print output of command
